Extending the Application
Adding New Gestures
. Update the initializeGestures() method in SignLanguageModel . Add gesture patterns and translations . Update the gesture library UI

Adding New Languages
Add language option to the HTML select element
Update gesture translations in the model
Ensure Web Speech API voice availability
Advanced ML Integration
The current implementation uses rule-based recognition. For production use, consider:

TensorFlow.js models for gesture classification
Custom training data collection
Deep learning-based pose estimation
Accessibility Features
High contrast mode support
Keyboard navigation compatibility
Screen reader friendly markup
Reduced motion preferences
Focus indicators for interactive elements
Privacy & Security
Local processing - no data sent to external servers
Camera access only when explicitly granted
No persistent storage of video or personal data
HTTPS recommended for production deployment
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Camera not working

Check browser permissions
Ensure HTTPS or localhost
Try different browsers
Poor recognition accuracy

Improve lighting conditions
Position hand clearly in frame
Hold gestures steady for 1+ seconds
No voice output

Check browser audio permissions
Verify speech synthesis support
Try different languages/voices
Debug Mode
Access the browser developer console for detailed logging:

// Access app instance
window.signLanguageApp

// View recognition history
window.signLanguageApp.signLanguageModel.getHistory()

// Export model data
window.signLanguageApp.signLanguageModel.exportModel()
